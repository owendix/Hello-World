My tool for getting used to GitHub

I am a physicist with scientific computation and data analysis experience. For 
me, programming is a great tool for understanding the world.

My experience is largely in C++, Perl, Python, Matlab, and Unix shell scripting.

Terminology
Branch: different versions of a file
Commits: saved changes to a file
Commit message: each commit has one - why this commit was made. Change history.
Merge: combine pull request with other branch, after review --> can delete old branch
Pull request: proposal of changes and request for someone to review/merge (perhaps me)
